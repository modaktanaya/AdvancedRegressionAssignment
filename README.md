## General Information
US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

##### The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

#### The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.


## Conclusions
### Top 5 significant features impacting house prices are:
1. #### OverallQual_Excellent
2. #### GarageCars
3. #### Neighborhood_NoRidge
4. #### FullBath

- #### Ridge - 3.0
- #### Lasso - 0.0001
